# S22 remaining acceptance evidence

This register distinguishes completed deployment/onboarding evidence from remaining
live product and recovery/capacity proof. It does not declare S22 acceptance.

## Preserved evidence

- Staff owner sign-in works in normal Chrome (owner confirmed). Do not reopen Auth0/MFA.
- Instagram Professional is Connected and messaging is active (owner confirmed after
  deployment of `a4fe54eb0c3d3b94df2d289fb917115034291b50`). Do not repeat OAuth.
- That runtime deployment used immutable API/Web/Worker/Migrator digests, had only
  four in-place workload updates, and converged with exit code 0. Runs:
  images `37136380118`, plan `37136692413`, apply `37136820128`, verification
  `37136945055`.
- Migration validation already passed: 32 migrations through
  `0031_s22_widget_inbound_route_management`, 52 tables, FORCE RLS and role isolation.
  Do not rerun migrations for subsequent acceptance checks.
- Read-only inventory run `37138195857` confirmed RUNNABLE/private PostgreSQL 17,
  shared-core tier, backups/PITR enabled, ready worker and both enabled alert policies
  with notification channels. Actual backup `1790989200000` completed at
  `2026-10-03T02:57:03.193Z`. This is backup existence proof, not measured RPO/RTO.
  Its only failed assertion was a verification bug: `/` intentionally redirects to
  `/staff`; the probe now checks the organization-bound staff shell directly.
- Corrected inventory run `37138390710` passed all 12 prerequisites at
  `2026-10-03T16:51:52.016Z`, using evidence-tooling commit
  `d5ae4176e53794b4bb7ea7e829408b9fd43225e0`. API health and the organization-bound
  staff shell both returned HTTP 200. Artifact SHA256:
  `82fecbc2724987e9c72d762a74ec4f3991253a912c88d19359164966ad7dbbe2`.
  The artifact explicitly records no infrastructure mutation, secret payload access,
  restore proof or capacity proof. Runtime images remain on the already-proven
  `a4fe54eb0c3d3b94df2d289fb917115034291b50` deployment.

## Remaining gates

| Gate | Evidence still required |
| --- | --- |
| Instagram DM | Real synthetic inbound, eligibility suppression/enablement, same-DM reply, tenant routing |
| Website Widget | Real allowed/disallowed cross-origin embed, meaningful response, session and token isolation |
| Gemini and business journey | Approved live model, bounded cost ledger, grounding/qualification/request/staff acceptance/customer confirmation, deterministic medical safety |
| Observability | Actual meaningful-response TTFR, queue/provider/channel failures and cost without message content |
| Recovery | Actual completed backup, isolated restore, representative data/encryption/RLS validation, measured RPO/RTO, rollback and queue drain |
| Capacity | Fake-provider normal/burst/bounded stress traffic, error/latency/resource measurements and safe operating envelope |
| Telegram Business (may run last) | Real business connection with `can_reply`, tenant binding, inbound business DM and same-DM reply; no standalone bot-chat substitute |
| Final gate | One authoritative `pnpm ci:verify` on the final coherent S22 tree, then exact verified promotion |

The `acceptance-inventory` phase of Staging Terraform is strictly read-only. It lists
live backup/PITR, worker readiness, public health and configured alert prerequisites
using existing WIF permissions. It reads no secret values, does not initialize or
apply Terraform, does not redeploy services or execute the migrator. Its allowlisted
artifact is prerequisite evidence only: it never claims restore or capacity PASS.

Keep Cloud SQL running during active DB-dependent S22 work. S23 remains out of scope.
